# About #
Viking's Story is an open-source tower defence game.
It is my first bigger project and I'm working on it for
quite long time because of obligations I have (school, etc.),
but I believe it will be finished someday.

# Introduction #
Before the Ragnar√∂k, goddess Hel wanted to destroy Midgard so only gods
would exist after the New world is created. She envies every human in
Midgard, and therefore she rose an army of soulless monsters to defeat
them. Odin, knowing that, sends his first warrior who ever came to Valhalla.
Now, it's only up to him will humans rise from ashes, or turn into it.
